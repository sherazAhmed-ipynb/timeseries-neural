# Time Series Forecasting with TensorFlow

This repository focuses on **time series analysis and forecasting** using deep learning techniques powered by TensorFlow and Keras. It includes hands-on implementations across various datasets to understand and predict future values in time-dependent data.

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights

- Preprocessing and visualizing time series data
- Windowing techniques for supervised learning
- LSTM and RNN-based models for forecasting
- Evaluation metrics and model tuning
- Exploratory use of statistical methods vs deep learning models

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels

## ðŸ“Š Datasets Used

Some datasets used for time series forecasting:

- Jena Climate Dataset (Weather)
- Electricity Consumption Data
- Stock Price Series (e.g., Google/Amazon)
- Air Passenger Data

## ðŸ“ˆ Models Covered

- Dense Neural Networks (DNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Baseline and Naive Forecasting
- ARIMA (via `statsmodels`)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sherazAhmed-ipynb/timeseries-neural.git
cd timeseries-neural

conda create -n tf_env python=3.10
